## Welcome to our project

In this project, you can view the top 20 songs worldwide or check out the top 20 songs for each country on the charts page based on their overall ranking in the country or based on their ranking by city or genre. We have created pages for songs, artists, and albums where you can access a lot of details.

This project includes an amazing music player that allows you to play your favorite songs. You can skip to the next or previous song, use shuffle or repeat mode, adjust the volume, like your favorite song, and more.

The project also includes a favorites page where you can view your liked music.

## Overview:

## Technologies:

React has been used as the main developer library in this project. We used Redux for managing data and states, Tailwind for styling, and React Router for pagination. The popular Axios library was used for fetching data, along with other libraries such as React Helmet, React Loading, Swiper, and Fortawesome.

## Challenges and Future Features:

Music playback was the hardest and most challenging part of this project. Many days were spent learning HTMLMediaElement and MediaSession and implementing them in this project, especially if you try to implement it without using a library.

In the future, I hope to create sections such as the playlist page and pages to display top artists.

Documentation like React, Tailwind, and Redux also helps a lot in navigating the project.

These are just a small but important part of the project that I recommend studying if you want to create a similar project, as you will need them later on.
